## Properties

### cameraType

> **cameraType**: `"user"` \| `"environment"`

Specifies the camera type for which certain features are enabled or disabled.
For example, surface tracking features are only active when the camera is set to "environment" mode.
The default value is "user", which accommodates the majority of Lenses.
"user" refers to the front-facing camera, while "environment" refers to the rear-facing camera.

***

### fpsLimit

> **fpsLimit**: `number`

Limits the frames per second (FPS) to optimize performance by reducing compute resources
when high FPS is not critical. By default, no limit is set, allowing usage of the video's native FPS.
Useful for controlling resource usage on varying device capabilities.
