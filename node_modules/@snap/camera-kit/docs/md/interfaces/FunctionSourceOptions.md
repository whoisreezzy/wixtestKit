### cameraType

> **cameraType**: `"user"` \| `"environment"`

Specifies the camera type for which certain features are enabled or disabled.
For example, surface tracking features are only active when the camera is set to "environment" mode.
The default value is "user", which accommodates the majority of Lenses.
"user" refers to the front-facing camera, while "environment" refers to the rear-facing camera.
