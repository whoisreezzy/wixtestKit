# Interface: EstimatedLensPerformance

Some lenses may decide to modify their behavior based on the performance of the current environment. If you are
using such lenses, providing an estimation of lens performance may lead to better user experience (especially on
low-performance devices).

The cluster value will be an integer from 1-6 which classifies expected lens performance, where 6 is the highest-
performing cluster and 1 the lowest.

All the raw benchmark results used to estimate the performance cluster are also included for reporting purposes.
