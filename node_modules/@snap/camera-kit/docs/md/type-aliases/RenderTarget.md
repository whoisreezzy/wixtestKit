# Type Alias: RenderTarget

> **RenderTarget**: `"live"` \| `"capture"`

Enumerates the supported render targets.

Lenses may render to different render targets, as designed by the lens creator. In CameraKit, it's possible to choose
which render target to render, and the result for each target is available as a separate `<canvas>` element.
