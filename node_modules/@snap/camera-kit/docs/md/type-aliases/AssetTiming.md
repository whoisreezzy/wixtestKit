# Type Alias: AssetTiming

> **AssetTiming**: `"required"` \| `"onDemand"`

Lens assets are included in a manifest, and each will indicate when that asset will be used by the lens.

Assets can have the following timing values:
- `required`: the lens will definitely request this asset immediately when the lens is applied.
- `onDemand`: the lens may request this asset at some time while the lens is applied.

Depending on the use-case, an application may want to cache both required and onDemand assets for
a particular lens, or may decide to only cache required assets (or cache no assets).
