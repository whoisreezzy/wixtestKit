# Type Alias: LensView

> **LensView**: `MakeTaggedBusinessEvent`\<`"lensView"`\>

The LensView metric is emitted after a lens has been viewed (for longer than 100ms), when the lens is turned off.

It contains information about rendering performance.

Notes:
  - If the page is hidden (e.g. user switches to a different tab, or application, or closes the tab, or closes the
    browser, navigates to a new page, refreshes, etc.) this metric will be emitted at that time. This is to ensure
    we don't lose the metric if the page is closed.
  - If the page is hidden and then made visible again later (e.g. user switches to a different tab, then back), we
    will begin measuring a new LensView. That is, we will not capture the time when the page is hidden even if the
    lens is still rendering in the background.
