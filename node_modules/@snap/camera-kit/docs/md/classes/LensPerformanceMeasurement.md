# Class: LensPerformanceMeasurement

Represents an ongoing measurement of rendering metrics.

An instance of this class is obtained by calling [LensPerformanceMetrics.beginMeasurement](LensPerformanceMetrics.md#beginmeasurement). Then it may be
used to record rendering performance metrics, reset measurement, or end the measurement.

## Constructors

### new LensPerformanceMeasurement()

> **new LensPerformanceMeasurement**(`instances`): [`LensPerformanceMeasurement`](LensPerformanceMeasurement.md)

#### Parameters

##### instances

`Set`\<[`LensPerformanceMeasurement`](LensPerformanceMeasurement.md)\>

#### Returns

[`LensPerformanceMeasurement`](LensPerformanceMeasurement.md)

## Methods

### measure()

> **measure**(): [`ComputedFrameMetrics`](../interfaces/ComputedFrameMetrics.md)

Return a [ComputedFrameMetrics](../interfaces/ComputedFrameMetrics.md) object, containing lens performance metrics.

This method may be called multiple times, each time reporting values computed since the time when this instance
was created.

#### Returns

[`ComputedFrameMetrics`](../interfaces/ComputedFrameMetrics.md)

***

### reset()

> **reset**(): `void`

Reset the measured performance statistics (averages, std deviations). This is equivalent to using
[LensPerformanceMetrics.beginMeasurement](LensPerformanceMetrics.md#beginmeasurement) to create a new LensPerformanceMeasurement instance, but may be
more convenient.

#### Returns

`void`

***

### end()

> **end**(): `void`

Stop measuring performance statistics.

This instance will not be garbage collected until this method is called. Therefore it is important to call this
method at the appropriate time to avoid leaking memory -- particularly if your application creates many
LensPerformanceMeasurement instances.

#### Returns

`void`
